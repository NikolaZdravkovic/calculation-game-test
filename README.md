# Calculation game

Welcome to my calculation game test task. This is a task that was written by one of the companies I applied to in the past. The point of the task is to create a simple calculation game that will use Redux/Redux-toolkit for state management as well testing with Jest and Cypress and styling the app with Material UI. Hope you like it, Cheers!
